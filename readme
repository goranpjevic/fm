                                  file manager

terminal file manager.

notes:

  - 'zsh' must be installed for 'fm' to work

  - all searches are case insensitive

  - when executing a shell command, use '$.' to reference the highlighted file
    or directory, and '$%' to reference all the displayed files or directories

installation:

  - add the 'fm' script to $PATH

  - to cd to last open directory in fm, add the following to your shell
    configuration file (e.g. '~/.zshrc'):

      #start fm, and cd to last directory on exit
      f() {   
              tmp="$(mktemp)"
              fm ${1:=.} $tmp
              cd "$(cat "$tmp")"
              rm -f "$tmp"
      }
