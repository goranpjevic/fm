                                      lake

terminal file manager.

installation:

  - 'zsh' must be installed for 'lake' to work

  - to use the fuzzy finder, install 'fzf'

  - add the 'lake' script to $PATH

  - to cd to last open directory in lake, add the following to your shell
    configuration file (e.g. '~/.zshrc'):

      #start lake, and cd to last directory on exit
      l() {   
              ldir="$HOME/.local/var/lake/ldir"
              lake ${1:=.} $ldir
              cd "$(cat "$ldir")"
